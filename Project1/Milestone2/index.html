            A short paragraph about my education and
            a list of your degrees and diplomas.
            I was born and raised in Dominican Republic, I was educated there until I was 12 years old.
            From then on I have been educated here, so from middle school all the way to my last year of college.
            I have graduated high school and will graduate college this semester.

            <li> HTML </li> Not sure if it counts as a language but it is very straighfordward in my opinion.
            <li> CSS </li> Same as CSS, not sure if it counts but I think I am ok at it. I just have trouble remembering things.

            I mustly play video games and other type of games such as board games. My main hobbies are just playing video games with my friends and watching tournaments relevant to those games, specifically the fighting genre.
            I have slowly tried to get into game development because it is always in my mind so I hope I can do something related to that in the future. Lately I have also tried to familiarize myself with Java, since it is something I feel I must know better.
